# Intro Course Project App for the iPraktikum

## Problem Statement

As a home cook with a busy lifestyle, I often find it challenging to plan my meals and create a shopping list efficiently. When it comes to preparing a meal, I frequently struggle to remember the ingredients required and end up making multiple trips to the grocery store. This not only wastes my time but also results in unnecessary expenses and food wastage. To address this issue, I need a mobile application that simplifies the meal planning and shopping list creation process.

I require an iOS application that allows me to search for meal recipes based on specific keywords in meal name. With the vast array of recipes available, finding the right one can be time-consuming and overwhelming. This app should streamline the process by providing me with a list of meal names that match the keywords I enter. This way, I can quickly identify the recipes I'm interested in.

Once I select a meal from the list, the application should provide me with a detailed list of ingredients required for that specific recipe. Having this information readily available is crucial, as it ensures I don't forget any essential items while shopping. The app should also offer the convenience of adding these ingredients to a responsive shopping list.

The shopping list feature should allow me to easily manage the ingredients. Each ingredient on the list should be interactive, enabling me to mark them off as I add them to my shopping cart. When I tap on an ingredient, a line or indicator should appear to signify that it's been purchased. This visual cue is vital for keeping track of what I've already bought, preventing double purchases, and making my shopping trips more efficient.

Additionally, the app should provide the option to remove ingredients from the list in case I change my mind about a particular recipe or ingredient. This flexibility ensures that the shopping list is adaptable to my preferences and needs.

In summary, as someone who values efficient meal planning and a well-organized shopping list, I need an iOS application that simplifies the process of finding recipes, listing ingredients, and creating a responsive shopping list. With this app, I can save time, reduce food waste, and enjoy a more streamlined cooking and shopping experience.
